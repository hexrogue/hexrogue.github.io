Hi, I’m **Muhammad Nuh**. A fullstack developer and aspiring systems tinkerer based in Malaysia. By day, I build web applications; by night, I’m probably debugging a Go program, configuring a reverse proxy, or trying to understand how DNS *really* works.

I believe in **simple tools, readable code, and systems that don’t break at 3 AM**.


## Philosophy

- **Minimalism > Magic**  
  I prefer explicit code over framework abstractions that hide complexity. If I can’t explain how it works, I won’t use it in production.

- **Own Your Stack**  
  From database schema to Nginx config if it’s in the pipeline, I want to understand it. That’s why I enjoy fullstack work and self-hosting.

- **Learn in Public**  
  My GitHub is a log of experiments. Some succeed, many fail. But each one teaches me something.


## How I Work

- **Editor**: Neovim (with 200+ lines of `init.lua` I barely understand)  
- **Terminal**: Zsh + Tmux + `lsd` + `bat` because `ls` and `cat` feel too vanilla  
- **Workflow**:  
  - Write → Test → Break → Fix → Automate → Repeat  
  - Git commits are my diary: *"fix: actually works this time (hopefully)"*

- **Stack Preferences**:  
  - Backend: **Go** (for CLI/tools), **Node.js/TypeScript** (for APIs)  
  - Frontend: **Next.js** + **Tailwind** but I’ll hand-code CSS if it’s under 50 lines  
  - Database: **SQLite** for small projects, **PostgreSQL** when it scales  
  - Hosting: **Vercel** for frontend, **Cloudflare Workers** for edge logic, **EC2** for "I need full control"


## Outside Code

- I’m deeply interested in **Islamic tech tools** like accurate prayer times, Quran APIs, and halal verification systems. (Hence the `PrayerTime` project!)
- I read about **networking**, **privacy**, and **digital minimalism**.
- I drink too much yogourt.
- I once spent a weekend replacing my Ubuntu desktop with **Arch Linux**… just to prove I could.


## Security & Ethics

I take security seriously:
- Always sanitize inputs (even in side projects)
- Prefer HTTPS everywhere (even on localhost with `mkcert`)
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies. Fewer lines = fewer vulnerabilities
- Believe tech should **serve people**, not manipulate them

Feel free to [connect on GitHub](https://github.com/hexrogue) or drop me an email if you’re building something cool.  
I’m always open to **collaborations**, **code reviews**, or **ranting about npm/pnpm/bun**.
